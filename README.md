My Website - oguzgelal.com
=====================

This is the source codes of my website, *still under development*. Here are some information:

- I used **Composer** as the dependency manager.
- It uses **Slim Framework** for the backend and a **MySQL** database.
- As for the frontend, **Less** and **jQuery** are used so far.

Usage
--------------------

If you want to use this codes as a boilerplate, **you are welcomed to**. I was too lazy to install composer on my server so I just included all the dependencies here on GitHub. When you clone the repo, it will simply work. But if you have composer installed, a ``` sudo composer update ``` is adviced.

Database Configuration
--------------------
I use **MAMP** as a local server, which uses **apache**. And my webserver has LEMP stack installed so it uses **nginx**. So there are files for both configurations. You can use whichever you need.
