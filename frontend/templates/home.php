			<p>I will start with a cliche: I'm a <span class="tooltip" title="Yeah, of course this is dynamic. <br> What, you thought I update this every year ?"><?php echo date("Y")-1993; ?></span> year old programmer, geek, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_new">Stoic</a>, <a href="http://ind.ie" target="_new">open-source enthusiast</a> and a thinker. I enjoy watching movies <span class="desc-comment">(comedy, horror and drama)</span> and reading books <span class="desc-comment">(informative books, mostly about philosophy)</span>. I draw <a href="http://ctp200.com" target="_new">webcomics</a>, but nothing professional, only for fun. Other than that, I love music, especially classical and classical rock. I play the piano and the drums.</p>
